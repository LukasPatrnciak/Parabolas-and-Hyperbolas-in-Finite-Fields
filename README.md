 # PARABOLAS AND HYPERBOLAS IN FINITE FIELDS

 The content of the final work is to explain the issue of solving certain types of quadratic
 congruences. The final work is focused on solving equations of parabolas and hyperbolas
 in finite fields, including their respresentation. In the introductory part, the final work is
 focused on historical development of conic sections. In the following chapter, the basic
 mathematic concepts and definitions are described, in which conic sections, finite fields,
 quadratic residues and non-residues and many other related terms are mentioned. 
 
 The following two chapters are focused on working with parabolas and hyperbolas in finite
 fields, calculation of parabola and hyperbola points according to the different forms of
 their equations, as well as on the number of these points and their graphical display
 display. In the final chapter, description of specific computational algorithms and their
 implementation, which were designed to achieve the most efficient calculation of points
 of the parabolas and hyperbolas in finite fields, is stated. The conclusion evaluates the
 benefits of final work in this specific issue.
